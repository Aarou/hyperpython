Will it ever support Python 2.7?
--------------------------------

No. Python 2.7 will meet its end-of-life in 2020, and all projects that use it
should be planning on moving to Python 3.


Will it ever support Python 3.5 or lower?
-----------------------------------------

Probably not. Hyperpython uses a functional programming library called Sidekick_
which requires Python 3.6+. It is not impossible to port this library to 3.5,
but it is a very low priority for the developers. You can make this happen by
sending pull requests ;)
