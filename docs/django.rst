====================
Django configuration
====================

Hyperpython has a few integrations with Django that can be enabled by adding
itself in your installed apps::

    # settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'hyperpython.contrib.hyperdjango',
    ]

You're done :)

(Actually we have to improve this section of our documentation. Come later to
check it out. But seriously, you can use most of Hyperpython in Django already!)
